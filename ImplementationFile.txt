3. Implementation Details


The application (`app.py`) is initialized as a Flask app.

    app = Flask(__name__)

Data Structure:
Tasks are stored as dictionaries with the following keys:
- id: Integer (Unique identifier)
- title: String (Title of the task)
- description: String (Description of the task)
- isCompleted: Boolean (Status of the task)

        print("Task Manager API running at http://localhost:5000")
        app.run(port=5000, debug=True)
